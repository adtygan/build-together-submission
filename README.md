# build-together-submission

- In this hackathon we build Keynote AI, which can write slide deck content given a problem statement by the user.
- We use Relevance AI to solve this challenge by developing an agent called Joe.
- Joe can interact with the user using Slack making for a convenient interface.
- Once the user's problem has been gathered, Joe starts working and generates content for the slide-deck.
